# Interstellar Wallet

**Interstellar Wallet** is a cross-border payment app designed for merchants, offering a fast, low-cost, and user-friendly solution powered by the Stellar blockchain. It simplifies payments and customer retention by leveraging Stellar’s decentralized network, low transaction fees, and smart contract functionality. The wallet integrates peer-to-peer payment capabilities and QR code scanning for fast and easy transactions, making it ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, as well as non-crypto-savvy users.

## Features

- **Low-Cost Cross-Border Payments**: Leveraging the Stellar network's low fees and fast transactions, businesses can conduct cross-border payments efficiently, cutting out high costs and long wait times.
  
- **Business Token Loyalty Program**: Merchants can create and distribute business tokens that function as discount coupons. Customers earn these tokens with purchases, and they can be redeemed automatically in future transactions, incentivizing repeat business.
  
- **Peer-to-Peer Payments**: Users can directly send payments to contacts, simplifying personal transactions without needing to manage complex wallet addresses.

- **QR Code Payments**: Customers can scan QR codes for fast and easy payments, speeding up checkout times for businesses.

- **On-Ramp and Off-Ramp Services**: The wallet supports easy conversion between fiat currencies and Stellar’s native currency, lumens, ensuring a seamless experience for non-crypto users.

## How It Works

1. **Merchant Registration**: Businesses can easily create a merchant account through the app’s simple and intuitive user interface. No prior blockchain experience is required.
   
2. **Tokenized Discounts**: Businesses can issue their own tokens, which are stored in the customer’s wallet and automatically applied via Soroban smart contracts during future purchases.
   
3. **Smart Contract Integration**: Soroban smart contracts securely manage and apply discounts, automating the process without the need for manual intervention from merchants or customers.

4. **Stellar Blockchain**: The wallet uses the Stellar network to provide fast, low-cost, and decentralized payment solutions. Stellar’s asset exchange and anchor system facilitate efficient cross-border transactions.
